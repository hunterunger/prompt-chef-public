## Public Repository for Prompt Chef tech and styling.

Sensitive files and information is censored for security.

This repository is to show how I _made_ the platform, and not how to _host_ the platform yourself. There is way too much external implementation to include here (such as Redis setup, Firebase setup, cloud config files, etc).
